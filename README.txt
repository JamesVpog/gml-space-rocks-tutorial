Reflection:
I followed this gamemnaker tutorial (https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/space-rocks-gml) and used the sounds/music from the download link under the 3rd video in this link (https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/space-rocks-mods). Overall, I thought it was interesting to learn that games are essentially movies but with player input. Frames are important to keep the game steady and an objective with obstacles are important to keep the game fun! I had a difficult time with restart ing the game each time my player died, but it was fun to overcome that challenge. I give it a 7/10 on fun factor because it can be repetitive, but it is quite challenging to get a score of 1,000. If I had more time, I would add a leaderboard system and maybe an endless play mode with more bosses or other enemies. It would also be beneficial to add a real background or camera system.

New Mechanic:
I added a boss fight that occurs when the player reaches a score of 500 points. It shoots its own bullets that can hurt the player and is much harder to destroy than the asteroids. However, it gives the player 100 points when it is destroyed. The new mechanic is under the obj_boss, obj_wall, obj_enemy_bullet Objects and their corresponding sprite names.
